# ESP32 Environmental Sensors
This is the accompanying repository for all source code and additional material for the article series "Environmental Sensor usage withÂ ESP32", published on medium.com.

### NOTE: this is a repository that will be updated very frequently in the next weeks, so please be patient if a specific sensor sketch is not available for now !

Parts of the tutorial:
- Overview: coming soon
- Base Application: coming soon
## Temperature, Humidity or Air Pressure Sensors
- **AHT10** Sensor(Temperature): coming soon
- **DHT11** Sensor (Temperature and Humidity): coming soon
- **DHT22** Sensor (Temperature and Humidity): coming soon

- **BME280** Sensor (Temperature, Humidity and Air Pressure): coming soon
- **BMP280** Sensor (Temperature and Air Pressure): coming soon
- **BME680** Sensor (Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure and Air Quality Data): coming soon
- **DS18B20** Sensor (Temperatur in Waterproof cover): coming soon
## Air Quality Sensors
- **AGS02MA** Sensor (Total volatile organic compounds "TVOC" for Air Quality): coming soon

- Bonus - using ESP-NOW to retrieve the data from remote places: coming soon

For each tutorial you will find a subfolder with all material needed to follow the tutorial.

All available data sheets of the sensors are available in the subfolder "datasheets".
