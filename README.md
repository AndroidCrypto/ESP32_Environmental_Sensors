# ESP32 Environmental Sensors
This is the accompanying repository for all source code and additional material for the article series "Environmental Sensor usage withÂ ESP32", published on medium.com.

## NOTE: this is just a stub repository with no content. It will be filled in the next weeks, so please be patient !

Parts of the tutorial:
- Overview:

For each tutorial you will find a subfolder with all material needed to follow the tutorial.

All available data sheets of the sensors are available in the subfolder "datasheets".
